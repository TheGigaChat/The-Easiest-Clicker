# The Easiest Clicker for beginners

This is a code for the easiest clicker, which uses only JavaScript, Css, HTML languages, WITHOUT libraries.


## How to Upload

 - Download HTML, CSS, JavaScript files.
 - Open like own code. (I use a Visual Studio Code with extension "Live Server Extension" to represent a code in a browser.)
 - Start to play :)
